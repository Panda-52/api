* `/api/files?where=discussion_id=[DISCUSSION_ID]` for a list of files attached to a discussion
* `/api/files?where=task_id=[TASK_ID]` for a list of files attached to a task

<a name="create"></a>
## Uploading a file

To upload a file, make a POST request to:

* `/api/files`

The request content-type should be `multipart-form-data` and the file field name equal to `file`. To attach the file at the same time with the upload, send the `project_id` or `discussion_id` or `task_id` or `comment_id` data in the request. 

Here's an example using `curl` command line for uploading a file to a project:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "file=@file.jpg"
  -F "project_id=123456"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/files
```

or an example of uploading a file and attaching it to a task:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "file=@file.jpg"
  -F "task_id=90000"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/files
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response header `Location` will contain a link for the new file. The response body will contain the new file info.
 
If you do not send a `project_id` or a `discussion_id` or a `task_id` or a `comment_id`, the file will not be attached to anything, but it will have a `token` attribute. 
Use this token to attach the file to a project, a discussion, a task or a comment.
The file will remain in a temporary location until it is attached.

If you have trouble getting your code to work for uploads, take a look at this [sample PHP script](samples/file_upload.php).

### Required fields

When uploading a file: `file`.

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a file

To update an existing file, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/files/[FILE_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. Only the following fields can be updated: `original_filename` (for renaming a file) and `description`.

Example of request body:

```json
{
    "description": "latest design changes"
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated file info as in the **Getting a file** section.

<a name="attach"></a>
## Attaching an unattached file

For a file added with no `project_id` info you get a `token` attribute. To attach this file to a project (or discussion, or task, or comment), make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/files/[FILE_ID]`

with the `token` and `project_id` (or `discussion_id` or `task_id` or `comment_id`) in the request.

Example of request body if you want to attach the uploaded file to a comment:

```json
{
    "token": "060bee5d4f7aaf94ddd8629518260dc9",
    "comment_id": 123456
}
```

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting a file

To delete a file, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/files/[FILE_ID]`

If successful, the response will have a `200 OK` status code.

<a name="object"></a>
## The file object
