## Getting subtasks

You can list subtasks by making a GET request to:

* `/api/subtasks` for a list of all subtask from all projects
* `/api/subtasks?where=task_id=[TASK_ID]` for a list of subtask from a task
* `/api/subtasks?where=complete=false and task_id=[TASK_ID]` for a list of incomplete subtasks from a task 

Example of response:

```json
{
   "subtasks": [
       {
           "id": 1,
           "name": "Review design",
           "complete": true,
           "project_id": 4,
           "user_id": 1,
           "task_id": 7,
           "completed_on": "2020-04-22T06:54:52Z",
           "completed_by": 1,
           "created_on": "2020-04-22T06:50:55Z",
           "updated_on": "2020-04-22T06:54:52Z",
           "seq": 0
       },
       {

## Getting a subtask 

To get the subtask info, make a GET request to:

* `/api/subtasks/[SUBTASK_ID]`

```json
{
   "subtasks": [      
      {
         "id": 3,
         "name": "Present design to the team",
         "complete": false,
         "project_id": 4,
         "user_id": 1,
         "task_id": 7,
         "completed_on": null,
         "completed_by": null,
         "created_on": "2020-04-22T06:54:13Z",

## Creating a subtask

To create a subtask, make a POST request to:

* `/api/subtasks`

with the request body containing the new subtask info, as in the example below:

```json 
{
  "name": "Logo Design",
  "task_id": 546,
}
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response header `Location` will contain a link for the new subtask. The response body will contain the new subtask info as in the **Getting a subtask** section.

### Required fields

When creating a subtask: `name`, `task_id`

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a subtask

To update an existing subtask, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/subtasks/[SUBTASK_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the subtask name:

```json
{
    "name": "Changes to logo"
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated subtask info as in the **Getting a subtask** section.

<a name="update-subtasks-order"></a>
## Changing the order of subtasks

To reorder the subtasks in a subtask list you need to make an **[update task](tasks.md#update-subtasks-order)** request with a body similar to:

```json
{
    "subtasks_order": [ 39, 2, 10, 9, 11 ]
}
```

where `subtasks_order` is a list of subtask ids (from the list of subtasks from a task) in the new order. 

You can change the order of a subset of subtasks by sending only the list of subtask ids that changed their position.

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting a subtask 

To delete a subtask, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/subtasks/[SUBTASK_ID]`

If successful, the response will have a `200 OK` status code.

<a name="object"></a>

A subtask object has the following attributes:

Attribute|Type|Description
